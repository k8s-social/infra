## Info

The aim of this repo is to bootstrap the initial infrastructure enough to then pass control over to [k8s-social/gitops](https://github.com/k8s-social/gitops) for handling of applications.

Infrastructure is handled using Pulumi (in Go).

All (approved) pull requests will perform a `pulumi preview` and display the resulting changes as a comment on the PR.

Merges to the `main` branch result in `pulumi up` being run to apply all infrastructure changes.
